# T-DAO-White-Paper
T DAO - Non-Profit - MVX 
	1.	Purpose Statement
T DAO aims to set a new benchmark for transparency in the non-profit sector, showing how blockchain technology can create an accountable, community-driven model for charitable work. Through the Tears (2TT) token, T DAO seeks to empower members to direct funding, vote on campaigns, and support meaningful causes, all within a transparent, decentralized framework. T DAO envisions becoming a model for blockchain-based charities, demonstrating how decentralized governance can lead to impactful change.
	2.	Tokenomics Overview - Tears (2TT) Token
The Tears 2TT (2Tears Token) is a meme-based cryptocurrency within the MultiversX ecosystem, launched on the MemeversX platform. As a humorous, community-driven asset with a supply of two trillion tokens, Tears 2TT emphasizes fun rather than investment value. Introduced with a “fair launch” concept, Tears 2TT has locked liquidity to prevent rug pulls, providing a safer environment for participants.

Initial Supply and Allocation: The total initial supply of Tears was set at 2 trillion tokens, with a 50-50 split between liquidity and the initial participants of the launch. This balanced distribution supports both market stability and broad community participation.

DAO Holdings and Liquidity: The starting holdings of the DAO stand at over 900 billion Tears, with a significant portion allocated to liquidity.

Consistent Small Sales for Fund Generation: To support T DAO’s ongoing activities, a controlled, consistent amount of Tears tokens will be sold at a starting rate of 2 million Tears per day once the DAO is officially up and running. This gradual approach builds a resource pool within the treasury while maintaining market stability. The sale rate may be adjusted by a DAO vote, allowing the community to respond to changing needs or priorities.

The DAO treasury wallet alone holds over 350 billion Tears. Given the planned sale rate of 2 million Tears per day, the current treasury holdings are projected to last approximately:

350,000,000,000 Tears / 2,000,000 Tears/day = 175,000 days
175,000 days / 365 days/year ≈ 479 years

Non-Financial Purpose: T DAO and the Tears token are not intended as investments. The focus of Tears (2TT) is purely community-driven governance and charitable impact. Its main purpose is to support T DAO’s mission and goals in a fair and transparent environment, where participants contribute directly to the DAO’s initiatives.

Contingency Plan for Token Destruction: If T DAO ever ceases operations or if the project becomes non-functional, all remaining Tears tokens in the treasury will be destroyed. This final action is subject to DAO approval, ensuring that the community has control over the project’s final steps.

	3.	Rank System
T DAO’s rank system recognizes members for their engagement and commitment to the DAO’s mission, with each rank reflecting a specific level of governance influence. Members can advance through ranks by accumulating Tears, and verified accounts receive a voting power multiplier. The numeric voting power of each rank may be adjusted by a DAO vote, allowing the community to shape governance as the organization grows. The ranks and their initial power levels are as follows:

Crybaby: 2 Tears donated; power level = 1
Whimperer: 10,000 Tears donated; power level = 5
Mourner: 1 million Tears donated; power level = 10
Tearbearer: 100 million Tears donated; power level = 50
Tier Leader: 100 billion Tears donated; power level = 100

Verified accounts receive an additional voting multiplier (initially set at 2x), giving verified members greater influence in governance decisions while reinforcing transparency and accountability.

Rank progression empowers members to take an active role in governance as they contribute to T DAO’s mission.

	4.	Voting Power and Verified Wallets
T DAO’s governance model is designed for fair representation, with voting power assigned based on rank, which is determined by cumulative donations. Verified wallets further enhance governance accountability through an additional multiplier.

Power Level by Rank: Each rank’s power level is based on cumulative Tears donations, not holdings, allowing members who have contributed more to play a larger role in decision-making. This structure ensures that power within T DAO reflects members’ commitment to its mission.

Verified Wallets and Multiplier: Verified wallets receive a voting multiplier, initially set at 2x, to encourage transparency within the DAO. The multiplier can be adjusted by community vote, allowing the DAO to adapt governance as needed.

Inclusivity and Flexibility: Unverified wallets maintain their assigned power level, ensuring that all wallets, verified or not, have a voice in governance. This balanced approach supports broad accessibility while encouraging verified participation.

	5.	Task-Based Contributions for DAO Wallets
T DAO encourages active participation by enabling wallets to contribute their time and skills through community-approved tasks. This system fosters engagement, allowing members to support T DAO’s mission while enhancing their governance involvement. Members may contribute by donating time, skills, or Tears, strengthening the community’s collective impact.

Task Proposal and Approval: Tasks can be proposed by any member who has reached a sufficient rank or verification level. Proposed tasks are reviewed by the DAO, and the community votes on which tasks are added to the task board for completion by interested members.

Contribution Structure: Each task includes an assigned contribution value, reflecting the task’s complexity, alignment with T DAO’s objectives, and time requirements. Regular reviews ensure that contributions align with the DAO’s goals and values.

Transparency and Accountability: All completed tasks and their contribution values are transparently tracked within the DAO, ensuring that members’ efforts are recognized and accounted for. Community feedback supports continuous improvement, reinforcing accountability and transparency.

	6.	Non-Financial Purpose and Focus
T DAO and the Tears (2TT) token prioritize community-driven governance and charitable impact rather than financial gain or investment purposes. Tears was designed with a non-financial mission, reflecting T DAO’s commitment to creating a decentralized, transparent model for non-profit work.

Emphasis on Governance and Community Contribution: The Tears token empowers community members to participate in governance, support projects, and fund initiatives approved by the community. The primary intent is to foster active involvement in T DAO’s goals rather than creating financial returns.

Clear Distinction from Investment Assets: While Tears tokens offer holders the right to participate in T DAO’s activities and governance, they are not classified as investment assets. This model aligns with T DAO’s dedication to advancing charitable projects and supporting causes rather than promoting financial speculation.

Contingency Plan for Token Destruction: If T DAO ceases operations or becomes non-functional, any remaining Tears tokens within the treasury will be destroyed, pending final DAO approval. This plan ensures tokens won’t be misused in the event of dissolution, preserving community trust and transparency.

	7.	Voting and Governance Innovation
T DAO is committed to creating an inclusive, adaptable voting system that evolves with the community’s needs, ensuring fair representation and accountability for all wallets involved. The governance model emphasizes flexibility, allowing T DAO to incorporate innovative voting mechanisms as the DAO grows.

Verified and Unverified Voting: T DAO supports both verified and unverified wallets, with verified wallets receiving a voting multiplier. This approach rewards transparency and accountability while ensuring all wallets have the opportunity to participate in governance, maintaining an accessible environment for contributors at any level.

Exploring New Voting Mechanisms: T DAO plans to test and implement advanced voting models to support inclusive and fair governance. Potential mechanisms include:

	•	Quadratic Voting: A method that balances voting power to prevent large holders from dominating decisions, ensuring broader representation of community interests.
	•	Delegated Voting: Allows wallets to assign their voting power to trusted representatives, encouraging informed decision-making even when members cannot vote directly.

Community Feedback and Adaptability: Regular feedback from T DAO’s community is essential to ensure the voting system remains effective and inclusive. All proposed adjustments or additions to voting options will be introduced and approved by the community, ensuring that T DAO’s governance structure remains flexible, transparent, and community-driven.

	8.	Tax Benefits and Compliance
T DAO’s structure is designed to ensure transparency and compliance with relevant tax laws, with an initial focus on meeting UK regulatory standards. The UK has some of the stricter crypto regulations, and by aligning with these, T DAO sets a strong foundation for compliance as it scales. As the DAO grows, we aim to expand our compliance framework to include additional jurisdictions, ensuring a globally accountable model for all members.

Potential Tax Benefits for UK-Based Donors: T DAO is actively exploring ways for UK-based donors to receive potential tax benefits, such as Capital Gains Tax relief on direct crypto donations. By maintaining a clear record of donations and contributions, T DAO enables donors to have transparent records for tax reporting purposes.

Future Goal for International Compliance: While initially focused on UK tax regulations, T DAO also aims to explore options for tax compliance in additional jurisdictions as it grows. Expanding to meet international standards could allow donors in other countries to receive similar tax benefits, furthering T DAO’s mission to broaden its global impact.

Ongoing Legal Consultation: To stay compliant with evolving tax regulations, T DAO will consult with legal experts, ensuring that members are informed about relevant tax laws that may impact donations and contributions. This proactive approach helps T DAO adapt to regulatory changes and ensures the DAO operates within legal guidelines.

Commitment to Compliance: Compliance with tax and charity regulations strengthens T DAO’s credibility and protects its members. By establishing best practices for crypto-based donations, T DAO seeks to become a trusted leader in the non-profit blockchain space, ensuring that members can confidently support the DAO’s mission.

	9.	Government Collaboration and Policy Influence
T DAO is committed to proactive engagement with regulatory bodies and tax authorities to establish best practices for crypto donations within the charitable sector. By maintaining open communication with government agencies, T DAO aims to set a standard for transparency and compliance in blockchain-based non-profits.

Partnerships with Other Non-Profits and Blockchain Projects: T DAO seeks collaborations with other non-profit and blockchain projects that align with its mission. These partnerships will strengthen T DAO’s impact and provide mutual benefits by sharing resources, expertise, and audiences.
